This is new (Alpha at the moment) Motioneye client only using its backend, and not webview like in other apps.

###  **Why using this instead other client apps:**


- It's fast, because you are not loading HTML and CSS at all
- Using **ONLY** motionEye Backend, which is faster than WebViews
- Auto DDNS and Local switching, which will increase Video framerate and quality in local Wifi newtork
- Fullscreen support


###  **Features:**

- Auto DDNS and Local Network Switching
- Using **ONLY** motionEye Backend
- Mulitple Devices and Cameras
- Fullscreen
- View recordings



###  **Developers:**

###  **Need To Be Implemented:**
